# Remote Rewinder 0.9


A client-server application which **allows remote control of a computer keyboard**. You can use this, **for example, while watching a movie to rewind or pause/resume**.

**The phone's physical volume keys are used to send commands to the PC** on WiFi network, so the user can comfortably rewind the movie without looking at the screen of their smartphone. The application runs in the background without any problems when the phone screen is asleep.

The perfect solution for those who do not have a wireless keyboard on hand ;).

In the future will be added a few new features to the apps and next I will release them on Google Play and Windows Store for free.
